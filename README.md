# FAQ

### Where is the server?
The server is located at the following URL   
- alpha.swequestrian.com   

### Where do I get the mod?   
- Ask AlaharranHonor :)   

### Submitting a bug report
To submit a bug report you can do so two different ways   
*Note: please use the template listed at the bottom of the FAQ*   

**1. The preferred method: Github Account**   
You are able to create a github account and submit bug reports at the top of the page under "Issues". This has a couple benefits
- You are able to actively participate in the troubleshooting process   
- You will be notified when someone responds to the report and can easily respond to additional requests   

~~**2. Secondary method: Email**~~ **No longer valid**  
~~There is an email you can send information to and it will automatically create a bug report without the need to create a github account. Unfortunately since this method forgoes the normal reporting process, you will miss out on the above points for using a github account. In addition, this is entirely anonymous so we have no way of figuring out who sent this information for a follow up.~~
~~- **Email:** foundabug@swequestrian.com~~

~~When submitting an email, the issue title will be the subject of the email and the body will be the details in the actual issue.~~

### Submitting a suggestion
We are plenty open to suggestions!
We want a seperate template for submitting suggestions though so we can keep them seperate from bugs.   
The template can be found at the bottom of the FAQ but please follow the naming convention.   

**title:** The **title** of the issue should begin with `[Suggestion]` and if submitting over email this would be the subject.
